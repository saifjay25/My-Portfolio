          <p>
            I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University and acquired a
            bachelors degree in computer science. I am now pursuing a full time
            position in software development specializing in android, java,
            python or front end development.

          <h3>Android developer</h3>
          <p>
            I interned for a company named LiveCare that developed in making the
            smart Life Alert. Instead of having just one button on the device it
            had a screen where the user (usually an elderly) can check messages
            and make calls to the user of the LiveCare app. This device connects
            to the app on a smart phone where the members (usually the family
            members) can check on the device's user. I asissted the senior
            android developers in software testing, debugging for the app, and
            contributed to the user interface. I mainly used Android Studio
            which uses Java as its programming language and XML to design the
            user interface.

          <h3>Owner of MyStorageBuddy</h3>
          <p>
            Developed and designed the app named MyStorageBuddy available in the
            Google Play Store. The app lets you organize the files (PDF, JPG,
            PNG files) you have on your device. You can download the file in a
            certain folder you created in the app. You can also view the file
            you downloaded inside the app. This app was made using Android
            Studio and the userâ€™s data is saved by storing the data in Firebase.
            The link to view this app in the Google Play Store is
